QUESTION 
Please answer the following:
The UK government has been revising numerous tax rules recently to address a 
combination of economic, social, and fiscal challenges. The lingering effects of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, and economic uncertainty have placed significant   pressure on public finances (Paterson et al., 2024). Consequently, the government seeks to   increase revenue to reduce national debt, fund essential services, and maintain fiscal sustainability. 
One driving factor is income inequality and the need for a fairer tax system (Limberg, #aa#t## Apps  Rees, 2018). Reforms, such as the abolition of the non-domiciled tax status,   aim to close loopholes that disproportionately benefit high-net-worth individuals, ensuring   greater equity. Simultaneously, adjustments like freezing income tax thresholds aim to 
generate revenue but critiques have raised concerns about fiscal drag impacting middle- income households. 
Another key goal of the UK tax reforms is to foster economic growth and competitiveness.   For example, changes in corporate taxation aim to   balance attracting business investment   while ensuring companies contribute their fair share. The government is also addressing sector-specific issues, such as increasing the Energy Profits Levy to capture windfall gains from high oil and gas prices. 
Finally, global shifts in tax policies, such as OECD-led corporate tax reforms, compel the   UK to adapt its system to remain aligned with international standards. These revisions reflect a complex balancing act between fairness, efficiency, and economic recovery. 
Required: 
Based on the discussion above, evaluate the impact of the UK government's recent tax 
policy changes announced in 2024 on individuals and businesses. Using specific examples,   critically analyse whether these changes align with the principles of fairness, efficiency, 
and economic growth. 
In order to meet the learning outcomes of   the assessment,   students   are   expected   to   address   at   least two key areas of   reform. (e.g., National Insurance Contributions, changes to   Capital Gains Tax, or the abolition of   non-domiciled tax status)   and provide recommendations   for   further policy improvements. You may organise your essay as follows:
1.       Begin with an overview of   the relevant 2024 UK tax policy   changes.
2.       Discuss the implications for different stakeholder groups,   such   as   employees, employers, high-net-worth individuals, or small and medium sized businesses.
3.       Apply theoretical frameworks like equity versus efficiency trade-offs   or the   Laffer代 写BE142: TAXATION POLICY AND PRACTICE 2024/2025

4.       Support your analysis with   examples, statistics,   or   case   studies.
5.       Conclude your essay by proposing well-justified recommendations for enhancing the   tax   system.
